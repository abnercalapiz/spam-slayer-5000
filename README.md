## Developer Reference

### Hooks and Filters

```php
// Modify spam threshold globally
add_filter('spam_slayer_5000_spam_threshold', function($threshold) {
    return 80; // Custom threshold
});

// Customize provider selection
add_filter('spam_slayer_5000_primary_provider', function($provider) {
    return 'claude'; // Use Claude as primary
});
```

### Database Tables

The plugin creates three tables:
- `wp_ss5k_submissions` - Form submission records
- `wp_ss5k_api_logs` - API usage tracking
- `wp_ss5k_whitelist` - Whitelisted emails/domains

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Which AI provider should I choose?**  
A: Both work well. Claude 3 Haiku offers excellent performance at low cost. OpenAI provides good accuracy but verify you're using valid model names.

**Q: Will this slow down form submissions?**  
A: The AI analysis typically takes 1-3 seconds. With caching enabled, repeated spam attempts are blocked instantly.

**Q: How can I reduce API costs?**  
A: Enable response caching, set appropriate data retention, and use Claude 3 Haiku for the best cost/performance ratio.

**Q: Is my data secure?**  
A: Yes. API keys are encrypted, data is sent over HTTPS only, and you control data retention periods.
